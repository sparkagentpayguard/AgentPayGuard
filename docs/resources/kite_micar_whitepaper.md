**08 CHARACTERISTICS OF THE CRYPTO-ASSET**
The crypto-asset referred to in this white paper is named “KITE Token” ( **KITE** ). KITE is a fungible
cryptographic token native to the KITE AI blockchain platform, a Layer-1 blockchain for agentic
payments with verifiable identity and programmable governance ( **KITE AI or Kite Network** ). KITE is
intended to serve as the native currency of KITE AI.
KITE is not pegged to any currency, is not redeemable, and is not intended as a medium of exchange
outside the project ecosystem.
KITE functions as the network’s utility token and is used for staking purposes, reward distribution, and
as a prerequisite for performing specific agent and service-related activities within the ecosystem. In
particular, it has three core functions:
▪ It is used for protocol rewards. Initially, rewards are fully distributed in KITE, and over time they
will gradually be paid in stablecoins instead.
▪ It is required for network participation. KITE users may perform services for the Kite network in
exchange for rewards. There are three roles that a user can take: module owner, validator, and
delegator. Any user who wishes to act as a module owner, validator or delegator must lock a
specified amount of KITE as staked.
▪ It is a fungible and liquid asset that can be used as a means of exchange or store of value within
the network. It enables smart contracts, interoperability between different modules, and
coordination between network participants.
**09 UTILITY TOKEN BENEFITS AND TRANSFERABILITY**
KITE grants access to network services by enabling the activation of specific operational roles within
the protocol. Holders may stake KITE in order to activate network roles (validator, module owner or
delegator) and may use KITE to enable participation in network coordination mechanisms, including
interaction with modules, cross-module interoperability and smart contract transactions.
**10 KEY INFORMATION ABOUT THE OFFER TO THE PUBLIC OR ADMISSION TO TRADING**
The admission to trading is sought in order to enable KITE to be admitted to trading on platforms for
crypto-assets in the EU.
The total supply is capped at 10 billion KITE. The circulating supply at launch will represent 27% of the
total supply. Kite AI Ltd. expects the token to be admitted to trading on leading EU-based crypto-asset
platforms that operate in full compliance with MiCAR.

## D.7 Key Features Of Goods/Services For Utility Token Projects

```
KITE functions as the network’s utility token and is used for staking purposes, reward distribution, and
as a prerequisite for performing specific agent and service-related activities within the ecosystem (for
further details see Sections F and G below).
```
## D.8 Plans For The Token

```
The project is structured as a multi-layer infrastructure designed to enable autonomous AI agents to
perform transactions, authorization flows and coordinated operations through blockchain-based
mechanisms.
The architecture is composed of a base layer optimized for stablecoin payments and state channels,
an application platform layer providing standardized interfaces for identity, authorization and
micropayment execution, a programmable trust layer enabling cryptographic delegation and constraint
enforcement, and a service and agent ecosystem layer designed to support discovery, interoperability
and SLA-based interactions between agents and services.
The project has defined the core identity model based on a hierarchical delegation structure (user →
agent → session), the constraint enforcement logic through pre-authorized spending rules and
```

```
session-scoped keys, and the micropayment framework using off-chain state channels with on-chain
settlement. Development has also included compatibility with existing standards, enabling interaction
of the agents across the ecosystems without adaptation.
The project architecture has been structured according to five core implementation pillars:
▪ a three-layer identity framework (user → agent → session), ensuring cryptographic delegation
without direct key sharing;
▪ programmable governance and constraint enforcement, executed through Standing Intents and
Delegation Tokens that mathematically bind agent spending and behavior;
▪ native compatibility with external agent protocols such as A2A, MCP and OAuth 2.1, enabling
direct interoperability without middleware workarounds;
▪ a state-channel-based micropayment architecture, where agents exchange signed updates
off-chain with a single settlement transaction on-chain, enabling sub-cent streaming payments for
high-frequency interactions;
▪ a dedicated stablecoin payment lane, providing predictable settlement costs, guaranteed block
space allocation for agent transactions and native support for batching, fee routing and
commission logic.
Future technical extensions are planned in the areas of:
▪ verifiable credentials for agents (with cryptographic attestation about capabilities, certifications,
and permissions);
▪ primitives for verifiable inference, proving not only what decision an agent produced but also
linking it cryptographically to model parameters, prompts and data sources;
▪ portable reputation mechanisms across the agent network;
▪ trustless discovery layer where agents locate compatible services through verifiable attestations
rather than centralized directories; and
▪ extended traceability layer so that every agent action pairs with attestations from relevant parties,
creating complete audit trails for complex multi-party interactions.

### PART F – INFORMATION ABOUT THE CRYPTO-ASSETS

## F.1 Crypto-Asset Type

```
Crypto-asset other than asset-referenced tokens or e-money tokens (Utility Token).
```
## F.2 Crypto-Asset Functionality

```
KITE functions as the network’s utility token and is used for staking purposes, reward distribution, and
as a prerequisite for performing specific agent and service-related activities within the ecosystem. In
particular, it has three core functions:
▪ It is used for protocol rewards. Initially, rewards are fully distributed in KITE, and over time they
will gradually be paid in stablecoins instead.
▪ It is required for network participation. KITE users may perform services for the Kite network in
exchange for rewards. There are three roles that a user can take: module owner, validator, and
delegator. Any user who wishes to act as a module owner, validator or delegator must lock a
specified amount of KITE as stake.
▪ It is a fungible and liquid asset that can be used as a means of exchange or store of value within
the network. It enables smart contracts, interoperability between different modules, and
coordination between network participants.
As noted above, participants in the network may assume one of three roles - module owner, validator
or delegator - each with distinct responsibilities and staking requirements. Their respective functions
are outlined below.
MODULE OWNER (Stake Requirement: 30,000,000 tokens)
A module owner is a business entity which develops and operates a module on the KITE network. A
module owner can be a single user who represents the module or a group of users who collectively
authorize transactions via multi-signature wallet. The module owner is responsible for ensuring that
the module expectations are met and that performance metrics are achieved.
VALIDATOR (Stake Requirement: 1,000,000 tokens)
KITE validators participate in a Proof-of-Stake consensus, locking up tokens to secure the network.
Each validator must select a specific module to stake on, aligning their incentives with that module’s
performance. Validator responsibilities include network security, governance participation, and
community engagement.
If validators fail to uphold their responsibilities or behave maliciously, they may be subject to slashing.
Validators also risk slashing if their chosen module behaves maliciously or fails to meet network
expectations. This system enforces accountability and ensures validators remain aligned with the
network’s long-term health and integrity.
DELEGATOR (Stake Requirement: 166,667 tokens)
KITE delegators lock up tokens to help secure the network and support their chosen module. Like
validators, they must select a specific module to stake on, aligning their incentives with its success.
While they do not perform any operational duties, delegators still share in rewards and may be
slashed if the module they back behaves maliciously or fails to meet network expectations.
```
## F.3 Planned Application Of Functionalities

```
The functionalities of KITE become effective from mainnet launch, as the token is required for staking
to operate as a validator, module owner or delegator. During the initial phase, protocol rewards are
distributed in KITE, with a gradual transition planned towards stablecoin-based rewards, while KITE
will continue to serve as the mandatory staking and coordination asset for participation in the network.
```
## F.4 Type Of White Paper

## F.5 The Type Of Submission

### NEWT.

## F.6 Crypto-Asset Characteristics

```
KITE is the native utility token of the KITE network and functions as a staking and coordination asset
within a Layer-1 Proof-of-Stake consensus infrastructure composed of the base chain and
service-specific AI modules.
The total supply of KITE is capped at 10,000,000,000 (10 billion) units. KITE distribution follows a
sub-linear emission schedule with four-year linear unlocks, and all initial allocations are subject to
locking mechanisms to ensure controlled circulation.
KITE is required to access operational roles within the network, including module owner (30,000,
KITE required), validator (1,000,000 KITE required) and delegator (166,667 KITE required). Staking is
necessary to activate these roles, and the protocol enforces alignment by associating each validator
and delegator with a specific module, with slashing mechanisms applied in cases of malicious
behavior or performance failure.
KITE is fungible and transferable and may be used as a settlement asset for on-chain coordination,
smart contract execution and cross-module interoperability, while transaction fees (gas) within the
network are denominated and paid in stablecoins to ensure fee predictability and avoid volatility
exposure.
Staking yields are targeted at approximately 4% annualized on staked value. In the initial phase,
protocol rewards are distributed in KITE, with a progressive transition to stablecoin-denominated
rewards over time, while the requirement to stake KITE to obtain operational permissions remains
unchanged.
The token model integrates reward-based incentives and slashing-based penalties: module owners,
validators and delegators receive rewards in proportion to their performance and contribution to the
network, while those failing to meet protocol criteria for availability or integrity forfeit pending unlocks
and/or future rewards.

### PART H – I NFORMATION ON THE UNDERLYING TECHNOLOGY

## H. 1 Distributed Ledger Technology

```
The network operates on a custom Layer-1 Proof-of-Stake blockchain built using Avalanche Layer-
technology, integrating AI service modules and a stablecoin-based gas model. The network introduces
a dedicated payment primitive with a separate fast-lane mempool and fee market, where only
whitelisted stablecoins are used both for value transfer and fee payment. The blockchain operates as
the base layer for modules that offer AI services to KITE AI users, with state channels enabling
high-frequency off-chain interactions anchored by on-chain settlement. The architecture maintains
compatibility with existing standards such as A2A, MCP and OAuth 2.1, enabling agents to transact
and coordinate natively across ecosystems.
```
## H. 2 Protocols And Technical Standards

```
The network follows an EVM-compatible architecture and uses the EIP-712 structured signing
standard for transaction authorization. Protocol-level interoperability is implemented through native
compatibility with A2A, MCP and OAuth 2.1 specifications. The payment lane supports memo fields
```
## including merchant category codes (MCC) and purpose codes. Authorization tokens follow a JWT

```
structure bound to session keys through cryptographic signatures.
```
## H. 3 Technology Used

```
KITE AI’s architecture represents a purposeful departure from traditional blockchain design. Instead of
building another general-purpose chain that happens to support payments, every architectural
decision optimizes for one goal: enabling autonomous agents to operate with mathematical safety
guarantees.
The architecture stacks purpose-built layers from blockchain to applications, each solving specific
challenges in the agent autonomy puzzle:
▪ Base Layer: An EVM-compatible L1 optimized for stablecoin payments, state channels, and
settlement. Unlike general-purpose chains, every optimization targets agent transaction patterns.
▪ Platform Layer: Abstracts blockchain complexity through agent-ready APIs for identity,
authorization, payments, and SLA enforcement. Developers interact with familiar patterns while
the platform handles cryptographic proofs and on-chain settlement.
▪ Programmable Trust Layer: Introduces novel primitives including Kite Passport (cryptographic
agent IDs), Agent SLAs (smart contract interaction templates), and compatibility bridges to A2A,
MCP, and OAuth 2.1. This layer ensures agents can interact with both Web3 and traditional
services seamlessly.
▪ Ecosystem Layer: Two interconnected marketplaces - an Application Marketplace for AI services
and an Agents Ecosystem connected through standard protocols. Services register once and
become discoverable by millions of agents.
Together, these layers let agents transact with predictable fees, enforce SLAs, and accumulate
reputation across accounts and interactions. KITE AI’s architecture achieves transformative results:
dramatic reduction in payment costs through state channels, significant latency improvement via
dedicated agent lanes, and complete elimination of credential management overhead through
cryptographic identity. More critically, true agent autonomy is realized with programmable guarantee of
constraint compliance.
```
## H. 4 Consensus Mechanism

```
The network operates as a Layer-1 Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain, using the same PoS mechanism
adopted by Avalanche Layer-1 architecture. Validators are required to stake KITE and participate in
consensus to secure the network. Slashing applies in case of validator misbehavior or failure to meet
network performance requirements, ensuring economic accountability and alignment with protocol
objectives.
```

## H. 5 Incentive Mechanisms And Applicable Fees

```
The network applies a Proof-of-Stake incentive model. Validators, delegators and module operators
receive protocol rewards, initially distributed in KITE and transitioning progressively to stablecoins,
targeting approximately 4% annual reward on staked value. Validator operations receive a minimal
base reward to cover L1 operating costs. Transaction fees (gas) are paid exclusively in whitelisted
stablecoins rather than in KITE, ensuring fee stability and predictable cost exposure.
```
## H. 6 Use Of Distributed Ledger Technology

```
True.
```
## H. 7 DLT Functionality Description

```
The distributed ledger operates as follows:
Three-Layer Identity Architecture
KITE AI introduces the first hierarchical identity model that separates user (root authority), agent
(delegated authority), and session (ephemeral authority) identities. Each agent receives its own
deterministic address derived from the user’s wallet using BIP-32, while session keys are completely
random and expire after use. This defense-in-depth architecture ensures graduated security:
compromising a session affects only one transaction; compromising an agent remains bounded by
user-imposed constraints; and user keys secured in local enclaves inaccessible to any external third
parties, which are thus highly unlikely to be compromised, represent the only point of potential
unbounded loss. While funds remain compartmentalized for security, reputation flows globally across
the system. Every transaction and interaction contribute to a unified reputation score, establishing a
cryptographic root of trust that spans users, agents, and services throughout the KITE AI platform.
Programmable Governance Beyond Smart Contracts
While smart contracts enable programmable money, agents require compositional rules that span
multiple services. KITE AI implements a unified smart contract account model where users own a
single on-chain account holding shared funds. Multiple verified agents operate through session keys
with cryptographically enforced spending rules: “ChatGPT limit $10,000/month, Cursor limit
$2,000/month, other agents limit $500/month.” Rules can be temporal (e.g., increase limits over time),
conditional (e.g., reduce limits if volatility spikes), and hierarchical (cascade through delegation levels).
These are not policies but programmatically enforced boundaries.
Agent-Native Payment Rails with State Channels
Beyond stablecoins and payments-first blockchains, the real revolution goes deeper. KITE AI creates
agent-first transaction types. Beyond simple transfers, KITE AI implements programmable
micropayment channels optimized for agent patterns. Instead of the traditional over-complicated
multi-party card rails of authenticate, request, pay, wait, and verify, payments are instantly settled
during agent interaction within the same channel. Two on-chain transactions (open and close) enable
thousands of off-chain signed updates, achieving sub-hundred-millisecond latency at $1 per million
requests. This architectural inversion, treating per-request and streaming micropayments as first-class
behaviors with sub-cent precision and instant finality, unlocks agent-native economics which were
previously impossible.
Chain of Trust with Cryptographic Proof
Every action in the KITE AI system creates a cryptographically verifiable audit trail, establishing an
immutable chain of custody from user to agent to service to outcome. This transforms agent
operations from black box mysteries into transparent, provable sequences where every decision can
be verified and every constraint can be enforced mathematically.
The chain of trust operates through three critical principles:
No Direct Key Access: The revolution starts with a simple insight: agents should never touch private
keys directly. Instead, each operation receives a one time, task scoped session key with surgical
precision permissions. An agent authorized to purchase data feeds receives a key valid only for
specific providers, exact amounts, and narrow time windows. When the task completes or the window
```

expires, the key becomes cryptographically useless. Even total compromise affects only that single
operation.
Fine-Grained Task Authorization: Permissions are scoped at the task level, not the agent level. This
granular authorization extends beyond simple spending limits. Permissions scope down to individual
API endpoints, specific data types, and conditional triggers. An agent authorized to “purchase data
feeds” receives a session key valid only for strictly enforced specific data providers, amounts, and time
windows. This granularity makes broad compromises mathematically impossible.
Reputation Without Identity Leakage: The relationship between users and agents creates a fascinating
paradox: shared reputation with independent identity. Each user and corresponding agent accumulate
their own track record of successful operations, building trust through performance. For each
user-agent binding, the reputation of the duo is inherited as a combination of the user’s reputation and
the agent’s reputation, and the operation outcome affects both the reputation of the user and the
agent, where the cryptographic binding to the controlling user ensures accountability flows upward.
Services know that behind every agent stands a real user with real stakes, even when that user's
identity remains private. Users can selectively disclose ownership when beneficial, but privacy remains
the default.
This architecture enables something unprecedented: complete transparency without sacrificing
privacy. Regulators can verify that agents operated within legal boundaries. Services can confirm
payment authorization. Users can audit every action their agents took. Yet sensitive business logic,
trading strategies, and personal information remain encrypted. The system proves compliance without
revealing secrets.
**Sovereignty through Separation**
KITE AI rigorously separates decentralized asset management from developer services, creating an
architecture where security and usability reinforce rather than compromise each other.
Decentralized Asset Model: The decentralized asset model ensures complete user sovereignty. All
funds remain in self-custodial wallets controlled by smart contracts that even KITE AI cannot access.
Users maintain exclusive control over their digital wealth while agents operate within mathematically
enforced boundaries. Users maintain independent access to their funds through standard blockchain
interfaces, regardless of KITE AI’s availability. This is not a promise or a policy. It is a cryptographic
guarantee.
KITE AI Platform Services: Meanwhile, the KITE AI platform provides the abstraction layer that makes
agent operations practical. APIs handle complex cryptographic operations, protocol translations, and
cross chain interactions. Developers work with familiar patterns while the platform manages key
derivation, session management, and constraint compilation. The platform never touches assets
directly. It simply provides the tools to make asset operations seamless.
This separation solves a fundamental tension in blockchain systems. Pure decentralization often
means terrible user experience. Pure centralization means unacceptable risk of single point failure and
user assets compromise. KITE AI achieves both security and usability by separating concerns
architecturally. Assets remain decentralized and sovereign. Services remain centralized and
optimized. Users get the best of both worlds without compromise.
The implications extend beyond technical architecture. Regulators can audit the platform without
accessing user funds. Developers can build sophisticated applications without managing private keys.
Users can delegate complex operations without surrendering control. Each stakeholder operates in
their domain of expertise while the system maintains security guarantees across all layers.
**Zero Migration Friction to Existing Standards**
Rather than creating another isolated protocol that fragments the ecosystem further, KITE AI
embraces existing standards as first principles. This is not grudging compatibility or minimal
compliance. It is not architectural integration that makes KITE AI agents native citizens of multiple
protocols simultaneously.
Google's A2A protocol enables direct agent coordination across platforms. KITE AI agents speak A2A
fluently, coordinating with agents from any ecosystem using established communication patterns.


When a KITE AI agent needs to coordinate with a Google agent to complete a complex workflow, they
communicate directly without translation layers or compatibility bridges.
Anthropic's MCP ensures model interoperability across the entire LLM ecosystem. Claude, GPT, and
other emerging models interact through the same protocol layer, making model choice a business
decision rather than a technical constraint. A KITE AI agent can leverage Claude for reasoning, GPT
for generation, and specialized models for domain tasks, all within a single workflow.
OAuth 2.1 compatibility means compatibility with human-centric services and existing login/payment
flows, thus existing services don’t need to rebuild their authentication systems. A service supporting
OAuth today can accept KITE AI agents tomorrow with minimal changes. This backward compatibility
creates a gradual migration path for developers where they can adopt KITE AI infrastructure without
abandoning the broader internet and enterprise ecosystems.
X402 standard compatibility enables agent-native payments, while Agent Payment Protocol integration
specifically optimizes for stablecoin payments on KITE AI, ensuring KITE AI remains compatible with
future developments in the agent economy. As new standards emerge, KITE AI’s architecture allows
rapid integration without breaking existing functionality.
These standards embrace transforming adoption dynamics. Developers don't choose between KITE
AI and their existing stack. They add Kite to enhance what already works. Services don't rebuild for
agents. They extend existing APIs with agent awareness.
**Terminology and Core Concepts**
Understanding KITE AI requires grasping the fundamental building blocks that enable autonomous
agent operations. These are not merely technical definitions but the architectural choices that
transform AI agents from sophisticated chatbots into economic actors.
Core Entities
The KITE AI ecosystem operates through four fundamental entity types, each playing a critical role in
the agent economy.
_User_ : The human principal who owns and controls a fleet of AI agents. More than account holders,
users represent the bridge between traditional legal frameworks and autonomous systems. They
delegate specific capabilities to agents while maintaining ultimate authority, manage master wallets
that serve as the root of cryptographic trust, and set global policies that cascade through all their
agents. Users remain the legally responsible entities, ensuring that agent autonomy never means
absence of accountability.
_Agent_ : A personal AI assistant or autonomous program acting on behalf of a user. These are not
simple scripts or API wrappers but sophisticated entities that execute complex tasks, interact with
multiple services simultaneously, and handle real money within cryptographically enforced boundaries.
Each agent maintains its own wallet, accumulates its own reputation, and operates under its own
governance policies. Yet they remain mathematically bound to their controlling user through BIP-32
derivation, creating provable ownership without key exposure.
_Service_ : Any external offering that agents interact with to accomplish tasks. Services span from data
APIs providing real-time market feeds to GPU providers offering inference compute, from SaaS
applications exposing business logic to other agents offering specialized capabilities. Services can
integrate through multiple protocols: MCP for model interactions, A2A for agent coordination, or
traditional OAuth for legacy compatibility. Each service maintains sovereignty over its access policies
while participating in the global agent marketplace.
_Merchant/Provider_ : The businesses, developers, or infrastructure operators who make services
discoverable and consumable by millions of agents. Providers do not just list APIs; they define SLAs
with automatic penalties, establish reputation through verifiable performance, and participate in
programmable commerce where every interaction becomes a micropayment. The merchant role
transforms B2B services from manual integration nightmares into plug-and-play agent resources.
Identity and Trust Infrastructure
Identity in the agent economy transcends usernames and passwords. It requires cryptographic proof,
verifiable delegation, and portable reputation.


_KITE_ AI _Passport_ : The cryptographic identity card that makes agent operations possible. Unlike
traditional credentials that merely authenticate, the passport creates a complete trust chain from user
to agent to action. It binds to existing identities like Gmail or Twitter through cryptographic proofs,
enabling users to leverage their existing digital presence. The passport contains not just identity but
capabilities: what an agent can do, how much it can spend, which services it can access. Most
critically, it enables selective disclosure. An agent can prove it belongs to a verified human without
revealing which human, preserving privacy while maintaining accountability.
_Decentralized Identifier (DID)_ : A globally unique, cryptographically verifiable identifier that establishes
immutable binding between agents and users. DIDs are not random strings but structured identifiers
that encode relationships. A user might have did:kite:alice.eth while her trading agent has
did:kite:alice.eth/chatgpt/portfolio-manager-v1. This hierarchy makes authority chains instantly
verifiable. Any service can cryptographically confirm that a session belongs to an agent, that agent
belongs to a user, and that user authorized the current operation. No central authority needed, no API
calls required, just mathematical proof.
_Verifiable Credentials (VCs)_ : Cryptographic attestations that prove specific capabilities or
authorizations. A VC might certify that an agent passed compliance training, holds a trading license, or
maintains a reputation above a threshold. These are not self-declared claims but cryptographically
signed attestations from trusted authorities. VCs enable fine-grained access control where services
can require specific proofs before granting access. An exchange might require KYC verification, a data
provider might require payment history, a compute cluster might require reputation scores. The beauty
lies in composability: agents accumulate credentials over time, building portable proof of capabilities.
_Proof Chains/Audit Trails_ : Every agent action creates an immutable, tamper-evident log anchored to
the blockchain. These are not just logs but cryptographic proof of what occurred. They establish
complete lineage from user authorization through agent decision to final outcome. When disputes
arise, proof chains provide indisputable evidence. When regulators investigate, they see complete
transparency. When users audit their agents, they verify every action. Traditional systems rely on logs
that can be altered or deleted. Proof chains provide mathematical certainty about historical events.
Wallets and Payment Architecture
The agent economy demands sophisticated wallet structures that enable programmable control
without sacrificing security.
_EOA Wallet (Externally Owned Account)_ : The traditional blockchain wallet controlled by a private key.
In KITE AI’s architecture, users maintain master EOA wallets that serve as the root of authority. These
wallets live in secure enclaves, hardware security modules, or user devices, never exposed to agents
or services. The EOA signs the initial authorizations that delegate specific powers to agent operations,
creating the foundation of the trust chain. While simple in concept, EOAs become powerful when
combined with smart contract delegation.
_AA Wallet (Smart Contract Account)_ : The revolutionary advance that makes agent payments possible.
Account Abstraction wallets are not just addresses but programmable accounts with built-in logic. AA
enables developers to write smart contract code that governs spending, bundles transaction
execution, and allows third parties to pay gas fees. These smart contracts interact with multiple
accounts, perform cross-program communications, and integrate customized logic. In KITE AI’s
model, the user owns a single on-chain AA account holding shared funds in stablecoins. Multiple
agents operate this account via session keys, but only within their authorized limits. One treasury,
multiple operators, perfect isolation.
_Embedded Wallets_ : Self-custodial wallets integrated directly into applications, abstracting complexity
while maintaining sovereignty. Users don't manage seed phrases or private keys, yet they maintain
complete control over funds. Embedded wallets enable one-click agent authorization, automatic
session management, and transparent fund flows. They make blockchain invisible to users who think
in dollars, not tokens, while preserving the cryptographic guarantees that make agent operations safe.
_Agent Payment Protocol_ : A comprehensive system that enables payment flows impossible with
traditional infrastructure. This protocol supports micropayments down to fractions of cents, streaming
payments that flow continuously based on usage, pay-per-inference models where every API call
carries value, and conditional payments that release based on performance. Credit cards charge


$0.30 minimum, making micropayments absurd. ACH takes days to settle, making real-time payments
impossible. The Agent Payment Protocol enables instant, global, programmable value transfer at
machine speed.
_On/Off-Ramp API_ : The bridge between traditional finance and the agent economy. Through integration
with providers like PayPal and banking partners, users fund agent wallets with credit cards while
merchants withdraw earnings to bank accounts. The ramp handles compliance, fraud prevention, and
currency conversion invisibly. Users never need to understand blockchain; they just see dollars in and
dollars out. This abstraction layer makes agent payments accessible to billions who will never own
crypto but need agent services.
Governance and Safety Mechanisms
Autonomous agents require sophisticated governance that ensures safety without sacrificing
capability.
_SLA (Service-Level Agreement) Contracts_ : Smart contracts that transform vague service promises into
mathematically enforced guarantees. Unlike traditional SLAs that rely on legal enforcement, these
contracts automatically execute penalties and rewards. An SLA might specify 99.9% uptime with
automatic pro-rata refunds for downtime, response times under 100ms with tiered pricing based on
performance, or data accuracy requirements with slashing for errors. These programmable
agreements create trust through code rather than courts.
_Programmable Trust/Intent-Based Authorization_ : Users express their intentions through mathematical
constraints that compile to blockchain enforcement. Instead of hoping agents respect policies, the
system ensures they cannot violate them. Intents can specify spending caps that cannot be exceeded
even if the agent tries, temporal windows outside which operations automatically fail, whitelisted
merchants or blacklisted categories enforced at protocol level, and complex conditional logic like "if
volatility exceeds 20%, reduce limits by half." These intents automatically expire, preventing forgotten
authorizations from becoming vulnerabilities. The user's intent becomes immutable law.
_Session Keys/Ephemeral Keys_ : Temporary cryptographic keys that implement zero-trust session
management. Generated for each agent task, these keys are completely random, never derived from
permanent keys, ensuring perfect forward secrecy. A session key might authorize "transfer maximum
$10 to providers A, B, or C for data feeds between 2:00 PM and 2:05 PM today." The key executes its
authorized operation then becomes cryptographically void forever. Even total session compromise
affects only one operation for minutes with bounded value. This architecture prevents the cascading
failures that plague traditional API key systems where one breach means total compromise.
_Reputation System_ : Trust scores that accumulate based on verifiable behavior rather than
self-reported ratings. Every successful payment increases reputation. Every failed delivery decreases
it. Every policy violation triggers penalties. But unlike traditional ratings that can be gamed, KITE AI's
reputation derives from cryptographic proofs of actual behavior. High reputation agents access better
rates, higher limits, and premium services. Low reputation agents face restrictions and additional
verification. Reputation becomes portable across services, solving the cold-start problem where new
relationships begin from zero trust. An agent with proven history on one platform can present verifiable
credentials to new services, bootstrapping trust through cryptographic proof rather than promises.
**Detailed Design**
The Three Layer Identity Imperative
Human payment systems recognize only two entities: the payer and the payee. This binary model
suffices when humans initiate every transaction, evaluate every risk, and maintain control over every
key. Agent systems shatter this assumption. They require a third layer that enables delegation without
the catastrophic vulnerability of key sharing.
_User Identity (Root Authority)_
The user maintains ultimate control as the cryptographic root of trust. Their private keys live in secure
enclaves, hardware security modules, or protected device storage, never exposed to agents, services,
or even the KITE AI platform itself. Users can instantly revoke all delegated permissions with a single
transaction, set global constraints that cascade through all agents, and monitor every operation


through immutable proof chains. This is not theoretical control through terms of service; it's
mathematical control through cryptographic enforcement.
_Agent Identity (Delegated Authority)_
Each AI agent receives its own deterministic address mathematically derived from the user’s wallet
using BIP-32 hierarchical key derivation. When you create a ChatGPT agent for portfolio
management, it gets address 0x891h42Kk9634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0eB8C, provably linked to
your wallet yet cryptographically isolated. This address serves as the agent’s on chain identity,
enabling it to authorize sessions for spending operations.
The mathematical derivation creates powerful properties. Anyone can verify the agent belongs to you
through cryptographic proof, yet the agent cannot reverse the derivation to access your private key.
The agent maintains its own reputation score, coordinates with other agents autonomously, and
operates within user defined boundaries that the blockchain enforces absolutely. Even total agent
compromise remains bounded by smart contract constraints.
_Session Identity (Ephemeral Authority)_
For each task execution, the system generates a completely random session key with address
0x333n88Pq5544D0643036b4c955Cc8f8706g1dD9E. These keys are never derived from wallet or
agent keys, ensuring perfect forward secrecy. They're single-use authorization tokens that execute
specific actions without exposing permanent credentials.
The session key generation happens entirely locally, without server communication or private key
transmission. Once generated, a DID session registers in the agent network, self-containing the proof
of authority, chain of trust, and validity period. The session validates through its time window then
becomes permanently invalid. Even quantum computers cannot resurrect expired sessions.
This three-tier model provides defense in depth that payments-first chains lack. Compromising a
session affects only one transaction. Compromising an agent is limited by user-imposed constraints.
Only user key compromise enables unbounded loss, and secure enclave protection makes this nearly
impossible.
_Identity Resolution Through Standards_
KITE AI extends ENS standards to claim agent ownership with human readable identifiers:
▪ User ID: did:kite:alice.eth
▪ Agent ID: did:kite:alice.eth/chatgpt/portfolio-manager-v1
Public resolvers enable instant verification:
▪ GetAgent (AgentID) → AgentID, AgentDomain, AgentAddress
▪ ResolveAgentByDomain ( AgentDomain) → AgentID, AgentDomain, AgentAddress
▪ ResolveAgentByAddress (AgentAddress) → AgentID, AgentDomain, AgentAddress
▪ GetAgentBySession (SessionID) → AgentID, AgentDomain, AgentAddress, SessionInfo
Any service can verify the complete authority chain without contacting KITE AI or the user, enabling
permissionless interoperability.
Programmable Governance and Money
Smart contracts revolutionized programmable money, but agents require programmable governance
that spans services, evolves over time, and responds to changing conditions. These are not simple
spending limits; they are sophisticated control systems that make agent autonomy safe.
_Compositional Rules Across Services_
Constraints combine through boolean logic to create sophisticated policies. “Total spending across all
platforms < $1000/day AND no single transaction > $100 AND only verified providers”. These rules
compile to smart contract code that evaluates atomically. Agents cannot circumvent limits by splitting
transactions or distributing operations across services. The blockchain becomes the ultimate arbiter,
enforcing rules with mathematical certainty.


_Temporal Evolution of Trust_
Static limits ignore the reality that relationships build over time. KITE AI implements progressive trust:
“Start with $10/day limit, increase by $10 weekly up to $100/day after trust is established.” The
blockchain automatically adjusts limits based on time and behaviour. No manual intervention, no
forgotten updates, just programmatic trust evolution that reflects actual agent performance.
_Conditional Response to External Signals_
Markets change, threats emerge, opportunities appear. Agent constraints must adapt: "If volatility >
20%, reduce trading limit by 50%." Oracle networks feed real time signals into smart contracts,
triggering automatic adjustments. When markets panic, agents automatically become more
conservative. When security breaches occur, new authorizations freeze. The system responds to
threats faster than humans can react.
_Hierarchical Cascade Through Organizations_
Enterprise deployments require nested governance: “ChatGPT agent limit $10,000/month, Cursor limit
$2,000/month, other agents limit $500/month.” Constraints cascade through delegation levels, with
child limits automatically bounded by parent limits. A department cannot exceed its division's budget.
An agent cannot exceed its tier's allocation. Organizational policies propagate cryptographically.
_The Unified Account Model_
KITE AI designs a unified smart contract account model that elegantly balances simplicity with control.
The user (EOA 0xUser) owns a single on-chain account holding shared funds in USDC or pyUSD.
Multiple verified agents—Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor—each operate this account via their own session
keys (0xSession01 through 03), but only through sessions that enforce rules and quotas.
When an agent executes a task, spending comes from the shared pool within its session allowance,
and the account pays merchants programmatically. Result: one treasury, per session risk isolation,
and fine grained, auditable control across all the user's agents. No fund fragmentation, no complex
reconciliation, just elegant unified management.
_Spending Rules versus Policy_
The system distinguishes between on chain rules and off chain policies based on their evaluation
requirements:
**Dimension Spending Rules Policy
Scope** Asset or stablecoin related, leveraging
programmable money
Full control and flexibility for
complex logic
**Evaluation** Entirely on chain through smart contracts,
ensuring transparency
Securely off chain in user's local
or KITE AI’s TEE
**Interoperability** Integrates with any on chain account, fully
decentralized
Platform specific but can
integrate third party systems
**Use Cases** Spending limits, rolling windows Session TTL, categories,
recipient lists


_Session Key Implementation with Smart Contracts_
The AA wallet smart contract implements session keys through a plugin architecture.
The user signs authorization transactions with their EOA wallet, representing cryptographic intent. The
transaction packages as a UserOperation and sends to a bundler for on chain execution. Sessions
expire automatically when validUntil timestamps pass, or users can actively revoke by calling
removeSessionKeyPermission().
_Programmable Escrow Contracts_
Beyond direct payments, KITE AI implements programmable escrow that places smart contracts
between agents and merchants. Buyers sign payment intents, funds authorize into escrow with
expiries, and later capture partially or fully based on outcomes. The protocolized contract exposes the
complete commerce lifecycle, including authorize, capture, charge, void, reclaim, refund, etc., while
remaining non-custodial and permissionless.
Additional "Operators" can submit transactions and cover gas but remain cryptographically
constrained by the payer's signed hash. Standards like ERC-3009 enable signature based, gasless
pre-approval. Because its code, escrow extends with business rules like revenue splits, token swaps,
or privacy modules, composing payments with other smart contracts. Every transaction becomes
programmable, auditable, and reversible.
Compatible with Agent Protocols
Modern agents don't operate in isolation. They integrate with Google's A2A protocol, Anthropic's MCP,
and enterprise OAuth systems. Payment infrastructure must provide native bridges to these
ecosystems, not awkward adapters.
_Protocol Translation_
Seamless mapping between agent communication standards enables universal interoperability. A
KITE AI agent speaks A2A to Google agents, MCP to Claude, OAuth to enterprise services—all
through the same identity and payment rails. This is not middleware translation; it's native multilingual
capability.
_Identity Federation_
Unified authentication eliminates the N×M credential problem. Users authenticate once with existing
providers; agents inherit permissions across all connected services. No duplicate credentials, no
synchronization nightmares, just elegant identity flow.
_Compliance Frameworks_
Built in support for regulatory requirements across jurisdictions ensures global operability. GDPR in
Europe, CCPA in California, data residency requirements in China—all handled automatically through
configurable compliance modules.
The integration happens through extended protocol definitions, combined with the A2A protocol.
This architecture ensures KITE AI agents participate as first class citizens in every major agent
protocol while maintaining their unique capabilities.
Programmable Micropayment Channels
Direct money transfers work for occasional payments but fail catastrophically for agent patterns.
Agents make thousands of tiny, frequent calls—messages, API requests, inference queries. Traditional
payments would cost more in fees than value transferred. State channels transform this impossible
economy into a profitable reality.
A state channel enables two parties to transact off chain with just two on chain transactions: open to
lock funds and close to settle. Between these anchors, parties exchange thousands of signed updates
instantly. This yields high throughput, low latency, and fees amortized across millions of interactions.
AI inference requiring sub hundred millisecond latency at $1 per million requests becomes
economically viable only through programmable micropayment channels.
Channel Variants for Every Pattern


KITE AI implements multiple channel types optimized for different interaction patterns:
_Unidirectional channels_ flow value from user to merchant for simple metering. Perfect for API
consumption, data feeds, and inference requests where value flows one direction.
_Bidirectional channels_ enable refunds, credits, and two-way value exchange. Services can pay agents
for data, agents can receive rebates, errors trigger automatic refunds.
_Programmable escrow channels_ embed custom logic in state transitions. EVM developers write
arbitrary rules: conditional releases, multi-party splits, time locked vesting. The channel becomes a
mini smart contract.
_Virtual channels_ route value through intermediaries without new on chain contracts. Agent A pays
Agent C through hub B, enabling network effects without setup overhead.
_Privacy preserving channels_ keep interactions confidential. Only channel open and close appear on
chain. Thousands of micropayments remain private between participants, protecting competitive
intelligence and usage patterns.
_Net effect_ : every message becomes a payment with sub-cent precision, instant finality, and minimal on
chain footprint. Perfect for agent pay per use and streaming economics.
How State Channel Limitations Become Advantages in Agent Economy
State channels carry known limitations from their Ethereum origins. But agent use patterns transform
these bugs into features.
_Open/Close Channel Overhead_
Traditional users rarely open and close channels, making setup costs prohibitive. But agents send
hundreds of inferences to the same service over minutes. Setup costs amortize perfectly across
concentrated bursts of activity. The "overhead" becomes negligible.
_Liveness Assumption_
Channels assume participants stay online to contest disputes. Human users go offline unpredictably.
But professional services with reputation at stake won't risk fraud for micropayments. The game theory
strongly favors honest behavior.
_Griefing Attacks_
Malicious participants could force expensive dispute responses. But agents and services maintain
reputation scores. Griefing destroys reputation for minimal gain. The attack becomes economically
irrational.
_Predefined Participant Sets_
Channel membership cannot change without closing. But agent interactions naturally have fixed
participants. User, agent, service—the relationships are determined at task initiation.
_Parallel Transaction Processing_
Channels process updates sequentially, working best for turn based applications. Agent interactions
are inherently turn based: request, response, request. The limitation perfectly matches the use case.
Dedicated Stablecoin Payment Lane
General purpose blockchains treat payments as just another transaction type, competing for block
space with NFT mints, DeFi swaps, and smart contract deployments. This creates an economic
absurdity: critical payment operations wait behind speculative trades while fees swing wildly based on
jpeg popularity. A simple $10 payment might cost $50 in gas during congestion, priced in volatile
tokens that change value between initiation and settlement. Bank style metadata gets bolted on
through fragile off chain systems. Privacy remains an afterthought. The result is a payment system
that fails at being a payment system.
KITE AI introduces a fundamental architectural innovation: a dedicated payment primitive with its own
fast lane mempool and fee market. This is not optimization of existing systems; it's recognition that
payments deserve first class infrastructure. Only whitelisted stablecoins can serve as both transfer


assets and fee payment, guaranteeing predictable costs denominated in real money. The system
cleanly distinguishes payments (which can include commissions) from transfers, implements bank
grade memo fields natively, enforces compliance policies on chain, and supports batching and state
channel micropayments as core primitives.
Architectural Principles
The payment lane operates on five foundational principles that transform blockchain payments from
afterthoughts into primary citizens:
_Independent Fast Lane_ : A separate mempool and fee market ensures payments never compete with
general transactions for block space. Each block reserves guaranteed quota for payment operations.
_Stablecoin Exclusivity_ : Both value and fees must use whitelisted stablecoins. This eliminates the
absurdity of paying transaction fees in volatile tokens that might double in price during confirmation.
_Payment Semantics_ : The protocol distinguishes payments (supporting commissions, reconciliation
data, and business logic) from simple transfers (peer to peer value movement).
_Banking Alignment_ : Native support for invoice numbers, merchant category codes, purchase order
references, and purpose codes brings blockchain payments to banking standards.
_Agent Native Capabilities_ : Intent references, mandates, carts, and micropayment channels layer
seamlessly on the payment primitive, enabling sophisticated agent operations.
Core Payment Operations
The payment lane implements five primary operations that cover the complete spectrum of payment
needs:
_sendPayment_
The primary payment operation routes through the dedicated Payment Mempool with rich semantic
support:
_sendTransfer_
Plain transfers without commission support use the Payment Mempool but with simplified semantics.
Same fee and policy rules apply, but no commission or complex reconciliation fields.
_estimatePaymentFee_
Returns base_fee, priority_fee_range, commission_estimate, and expected_slo_ms for fast lane
latency SLO. Enables cost prediction before submission.
_sendPaymentBatch_
Batch payments compress multiple transfers into single transactions. On chain compact encoding
uses recipient sorting and amount compression. BLS aggregate signatures dramatically reduce gas
costs.
Key features:
▪ Per item sub memos or shared batch memo;
▪ Optional atomicity (all succeed or all revert) for payroll use cases;
▪ Oversized batches automatically shard with Merkle proofs for parallel verification.
_Payment Channels_
State channels integrate natively with the payment lane through three operations:
▪ openPaymentChannel: Lock funds with guaranteed SLO;
▪ commitPaymentChannel: Update channel state off chain;
▪ closePaymentChannel: Final settlement through payment lane.
Enables "each message equals a payment" economics. Account for approximately $0.000001 per
interaction inside channels, amortizing fees across millions of micropayments.


Node and Consensus Architecture
The payment lane requires specialized node infrastructure to maintain performance and security
guarantees.
_Payment Mempool_
The Payment Mempool operates as an independent queue with sophisticated prioritization:
Structure and Quotas: Each block reserves X% exclusively for payment transactions. This guaranteed
quota ensures payments never starve during general network congestion.
Queue Management: Four sub queues handle different operation types:
▪ Payment queue for standard payments with commission;
▪ Transfer queue for simple value movements;
▪ Batch queue for multi recipient operations;
▪ Channel queue for state channel settlements.
Priority Algorithm: Transactions order by earliest deadline first, then fee per byte, then arrival time
(FIFO). This ensures time sensitive payments process reliably.
Admission Filtering: Pre mempool checks reject invalid transactions immediately:
▪ Non-whitelisted stablecoins blocked;
▪ Denylisted recipients rejected;
▪ Invalid signatures discarded;
▪ Expired deadlines filtered;
▪ Insufficient fees denied.
_Fee Market_
The payment lane implements an independent fee market optimized for stable, predictable costs:
Separate EIP-1559 Implementation: Base fee for payments adjusts independently from general
transactions. Congestion in DeFi doesn't affect payment costs. The base_fee_payment variable tracks
payment specific congestion.
Stablecoin Settlement Options:
▪ Option 1: Validators receive stablecoins directly. Simplest approach requiring minimal protocol
changes;
▪ Option 2: Protocol enshrined AMM automatically swaps stablecoins to native staking assets.
Maintains existing validator economics.
Commission Processing: Protocol governance caps commission basis points. Commissions extract
from fee addon rather than principal amount, keeping reconciliation clean.
_Compliance Infrastructure_
Compliance operates through the PolicyRegistry system contract maintaining three registries:
StablecoinWhitelist: Maps token addresses to configuration.
RecipientAllowlist/Denylist: Address sets with verifiable proof support. Entries can be individual
addresses or Merkle roots for efficient batch updates.
RuleSet Engine: Composes multiple compliance rules:
▪ Geographic restrictions by IP or declared location;
▪ Time windows for permitted operations;
▪ Transaction limits by amount or frequency;
▪ Category restrictions for merchant types.


Travel Rule Compliance: The protocol aligns with FATF Travel Rule and IVMS101 standards. Stores
only reference hashes on chain. Plaintext PII lives off chain with verifiable assertions linking for audit.
_Privacy Mechanisms_
Three privacy modes serve different use case requirements:
None Mode: Full transparency for public payments. All details visible on chain. Suitable for public
goods funding or transparent operations.
Stealth Mode: Recipients generate one time addresses for each payment. View keys enable selective
disclosure. Balances and transaction graphs remain private while maintaining auditability.
Shielded Mode: Zero knowledge proofs hide amounts and parties. Stablecoin shielded pool processes
private transfers. Compliance maintained through selective disclosure mechanisms.
Memo Tiering: Two tier memo structure separates public and private data:
▪ Public tier: Merchant visible data for reconciliation;
▪ Private tier: Encrypted data visible only to view key holders.
Semantic Payment Types
The protocol maintains clear distinction between payment types for accurate economic measurement:
Payments include:
▪ Commission splits for platforms and aggregators;
▪ Reconciliation metadata for accounting systems;
▪ Intent and mandate references for agent operations;
▪ Order and cart bindings for commerce.
Transfers provide:
▪ Simple peer to peer value movement;
▪ No commission overhead;
▪ Minimal metadata requirements;
▪ Maximum throughput optimization.
Nodes, explorers, and indexers differentiate these types to calculate accurate metrics like Gross
Merchandise Value (GMV) and platform take rates.
Optimization Strategies
_Batch Processing_
Large scale operations benefit from sophisticated batching:
Deduplication and Sorting: Remove duplicate recipients and sort for optimal compression. Amounts
compress using delta encoding from previous values.
Sharding Strategy: Large batches split into shards with Merkle proof linkage. Nodes verify shards in
parallel, maintaining throughput.
Failure Handling Options:
▪ Partial Tolerance: Skip failed recipients, process successful ones;
▪ Atomic Mode: All succeed or all revert for critical operations.
Export Formats: Indexers generate CSV and Parquet files for one click reconciliation. Standard
accounting software imports directly.
_Developer Integration_
EIP-712 Signing Standard: Separate type definitions for Payment, Transfer, and BatchItem prevent
cross domain replay attacks.


SDK Methods:
▪ signPayment(): Generate payment signatures;
▪ signBatch(): Create batch payment signatures;
▪ simulatePayment(): Test execution without submission;
▪ watchPaymentReceipt(): Monitor confirmation status;
▪ exportReconciliation(): Generate accounting reports.
_Agent Native Features_
The payment lane provides primitives that enable sophisticated agent behaviors:
Intent and Mandate System: Every payment references its authorizing intent. Smart contracts verify
payments fall within authorized parameters. Limits, categories, and time windows enforce
automatically.
Cart Integration: Payments reference cart snapshots through memo fields. Receipts include content
fingerprints. Disputes resolve through cryptographic proof of cart contents at payment time.
Micropayment Streaming: Agent to agent interactions carry payment vouchers in every message.
Settlements trigger every N messages or T time interval. Automatic fallback to on chain settlement
handles channel failures.
Programmable Settlement: Templates define complex fund distribution:
▪ Platform fees extract automatically;
▪ Merchant shares distribute proportionally;
▪ Creator royalties process recursively;
▪ Tax withholdings reserve properly.
_Security and Risk Controls_
The payment lane implements comprehensive protection against attacks and operational risks:
Denial of Service Prevention:
▪ Pre admission validation stops invalid transactions at the edge;
▪ Rate limiting throttles addresses generating excessive load;
▪ Economic spam becomes impossible due to stablecoin fee requirements.
MEV Resistance:
▪ First come first served ordering within priority tiers;
▪ Deadline enforcement prevents holding transactions;
▪ Private mempools available for sensitive operations.
Stablecoin Freeze Handling:
▪ Protocol detects issuer freeze events;
▪ Affected funds marked as “undistributable balance”;
▪ Receipts annotate freeze status;
▪ Reconciliation remains accurate despite disruption.
Emergency Controls:
▪ Governance can pause specific operations;
▪ Circuit breakers trigger on anomalous volumes;
▪ Rollback mechanisms handle critical failures.


This dedicated payment infrastructure transforms blockchain payments from expensive afterthoughts
into efficient, compliant, privacy preserving operations that match or exceed traditional payment
systems while enabling capabilities impossible in legacy finance.
**Security with Programmable Trust**
The promise of autonomous agents collapses without cryptographic security guarantees. Users cannot
delegate real authority if agent compromise means unbounded loss. Services cannot accept agent
requests without verifiable authorization. Regulators cannot approve agent operations without
auditable compliance. KITE AI’s security architecture provides mathematical certainty where traditional
systems offer only promises.
Core Cryptographic Components
The KITE AI protocol achieves unbreakable security through three interlocking cryptographic primitives
that create a complete chain of authorization from user intent to agent action.
_Standing Intent: The Root of Authority_
The Standing Intent (SI) represents the user's cryptographically signed declaration of what an agent
may do. This is not a policy document or configuration file; it's a mathematical proof of authorization
that cannot be forged or exceeded.
The Standing Intent signed with the user's private key becomes the immutable root of trust. Every
subsequent operation must trace back to a valid SI. The capabilities define mathematical boundaries
that cannot be exceeded regardless of agent behavior, model hallucination, or service compromise.
The expiration ensures forgotten authorizations cannot persist indefinitely.
_Delegation Token: Agent Authorization_
The Delegation Token (DT) enables agents to authorize specific sessions for particular operations
without exposing their permanent credentials.
The delegation token cryptographically proves the agent authorized this session for this operation
within the Standing Intent's boundaries. The hash linkage ensures the agent cannot exceed user
defined limits. The short expiration minimizes exposure from compromised sessions. The operation
scope prevents session reuse for unauthorized actions.
_Session Signature: Execution Proof_
The Session Signature (SS) provides the final cryptographic proof for transaction execution.
Services verify all three signatures before accepting operations. The Standing Intent proves user
authorization. The Delegation Token proves agent delegation. The Session Signature proves current
execution. This triple verification makes unauthorized actions cryptographically impossible rather than
merely prohibited.
Provable Security Properties
The protocol provides mathematical guarantees about system behavior under adversarial conditions,
transforming security from trust based to proof based.
_Theorem 1: Bounded Loss_
Statement: Given Standing Intent SI with capabilities C and duration D, the maximum extractable
value MEV under complete agent compromise is:
MEV ≤ C.max_daily × D
Proof: By construction of the protocol, each transaction requires a valid Standing Intent signature. The
cryptographic signature verification ensures only transactions with valid SI can execute. The provider
enforced capabilities guarantee no single transaction exceeds C.max_tx and daily aggregates cannot
exceed C.max_daily. Since the Standing Intent expires after duration D, no transactions can execute
beyond this time. Therefore, the maximum extractable value is bounded by the product of daily cap
and duration, regardless of agent compromise.


This theorem provides users with precise risk quantification. A user authorizing an agent with $100
daily limit for 30 days knows their maximum exposure is exactly $3,000, not a penny more. This
mathematical certainty enables confident delegation of real financial authority.
_Theorem 2: Unforgeability_
Statement: Without access to the user's private key, an adversary cannot create a valid Standing
Intent for unauthorized agents.
Proof: Standing Intent validity requires signature verification against the user's public key using
ECDSA or EdDSA algorithms. Under the assumption that these signature schemes are existentially
unforgeable under chosen message attack (EUF-CMA), an adversary without access to the user's
private key cannot produce a valid signature for a new Standing Intent with non-negligible probability.
The cryptographic hardness of the discrete logarithm problem ensures computational infeasibility of
key recovery from public information.
This theorem guarantees that attackers cannot create fake authorizations. Even with complete
knowledge of existing Standing Intents, observation of all transactions, and control over compromised
agents, adversaries cannot forge new authorizations for unauthorized agents. The user’s private key
remains the sole source of delegation authority.
_Additional Security Properties_
Beyond the formal theorems, the protocol provides additional security guarantees:
Forward Secrecy: Compromising a session key reveals only that session's operations. Past and future
sessions remain secure due to independent key generation.
Principle of Least Privilege: Each layer of delegation reduces authority. Sessions have less power than
agents, agents less than users. Authority only flows downward.
Automatic Expiration: All authorizations include expiration timestamps. Forgotten delegations cannot
persist indefinitely. Time becomes an automatic revocation mechanism.
Non-Repudiation: Cryptographic signatures provide undeniable proof of authorization. Users cannot
deny authorizing agents, agents cannot deny authorizing sessions, and sessions cannot deny
executing transactions.
Revocation Mechanism
Authorization without revocation is incomplete security. The protocol implements a comprehensive
revocation system with multiple enforcement layers ensuring compromised or misbehaving agents
cannot continue operating.
_Immediate Local Revocation_
Users broadcast revocation messages to KITE Hub, which instantly propagates to all registered
providers. This peer-to-peer propagation ensures near instantaneous revocation without waiting for
blockchain confirmation. Services receiving revocation notices immediately reject all requests from
revoked agents.
The revocation message contains:
▪ Agent identifier being revoked;
▪ Revocation timestamp;
▪ User signature proving authority;
▪ Optional reason code for analytics.
Network effects amplify revocation speed. Popular services with many connections propagate faster.
Critical services prioritize revocation messages. The entire network typically learns of revocations
within seconds.
_Cryptographic Revocation_
Users sign revocation certificates that providers cache and verify against.


Even if network propagation fails, cryptographic proof of revocation prevents continued operation.
Services check revocation certificates before accepting requests. Cached certificates persist across
restarts. Permanent revocations cannot be reversed, providing strong security guarantees.
_Economic Revocation_
Slashing conditions in agent bonds create economic incentives against continued operation post
revocation:
Agent Bonds: Agents stake tokens as collateral for good behavior. Bonds are proportional to
authorization limits, creating aligned incentives.
Slashing Triggers: Operating after revocation triggers automatic slashing. The protocol detects post
revocation transactions and burns staked bonds.
Reputation Impact: Slashed agents suffer permanent reputation damage. Future authorizations require
higher bonds. Services may refuse slashed agents entirely.
Distribution: Slashed funds are distributed to affected parties. Users recover losses from misbehaving
agents. Services receive compensation for processing invalid requests.
This economic layer ensures that even if cryptographic and network revocations fail, agents have
strong financial incentives to respect revocations. The cost of ignoring revocation exceeds any
potential gain from continued operation.
_Graceful Degradation in Adversarial Conditions_
The revocation system degrades gracefully under various failure modes:
Network Partition: Local revocation continues within network segments. Cryptographic certificates
provide eventual consistency.
Hub Failure: Peer to peer propagation continues without central coordination. Services share
revocation information directly.
Blockchain Congestion: Off chain revocation mechanisms operate independently. On chain slashing
provides eventual enforcement.
Service Offline: Cached revocations persist. Services enforce revocations immediately upon restart.
This multi-layer approach ensures revocation remains effective even under adversarial conditions or
system failures. Users maintain ultimate control over their agents regardless of infrastructure state.
**Agent Flows**
The lifecycle of agent interactions encompasses three critical phases: authorization establishment,
continuous communication, and value exchange through payments. Each phase builds on
cryptographic foundations while maintaining intuitive developer experiences and user control.
Authorization transforms human identity into agent capability through a carefully orchestrated flow that
bridges traditional web authentication with blockchain settlement.
The Authorization Challenge
The flow begins when an agent attempts to access a service without valid credentials. The service
returns a 401 Unauthorized response, indicating required authentication methods. This triggers the
authorization sequence that converts one-time human authentication into persistent agent capability.
Key insight: Gmail/OAuth proves the user's web identity (represented as did:kite_chain_id:claude:scott
for example, bundling Claude App with Scott's Gmail ID). The KITE AI session token transforms this
one-time proof into a time bounded, policy guarded capability the agent can use safely without
repeatedly exposing the user's primary credentials.
Authorization Actors and Sequence
Four actors participate in the authorization flow:
▪ Agent (e.g., Claude): The AI system requesting service access;
▪ Service (MCP server or service agent): The resource being accessed;


▪ Web Credential Provider (Gmail): The identity verification source;
▪ KITE AI Platform and Chain: The authorization and settlement layer.
The authorization sequence proceeds through six critical steps:
_Step 1: Initial Request Failure_
The agent calls a service without a valid token or with an expired one. The service replies with 401
Unauthorized, initiating the authorization process.
_Step 2: Discovery Phase_
The service indicates it requires web credentials and points the agent to Gmail or other supported
providers. The agent retrieves the authorization server metadata through standard discovery
mechanisms.
_Step 3: OAuth Authentication_
Standard OAuth 2.1 flow executes with Gmail. The user signs in and provides consent. The agent
performs the token request and receives an access token bound to the agent application, user’s Gmail
identity, and redirect details. This creates cryptographic proof that a real human authorized this
specific agent.
_Step 4: Session Token Registration_
After obtaining web credentials, the agent generates a local session key and registers a session token
with KITE AI Platform and Chain. This registration binds:
▪ Agent and application identity;
▪ Scopes and allowed operations;
▪ Quotas and time to live (TTL);
▪ Proof chain back to user authorization.
The session private key never leaves the local environment. A DID session registration call ensures
the session is registered, linked, and recognizable by other services across the network.
_Step 5: Service Retry_
The agent retries the original service call, now presenting the session token signed by the ephemeral
session key.
_Step 6: Verification and Execution_
The service verifies the token and checks it against KITE AI’s registry and policies. If the token is valid,
policies and quotas pass, and the token falls within its time window, the service executes the request
and returns a successful response.
JWT Token Structure
When a session key is authorized and created, a corresponding JWT token encapsulates all
necessary authorization information.
Once created, subsequent calls to any service in the network contain both the JWT token and the
session public key used for encryption. This dual credential system ensures both authorization and
authenticity.
**Agent Reputation and Trust Accumulation**
Existing blockchains treat all accounts as equals. A newly created address possesses identical
capabilities to one with years of legitimate history. This egalitarian approach fails catastrophically for
agent systems where behavioral history should determine authorization scope.
Trust Dynamics for Agent Systems
Agent systems require sophisticated trust dynamics that traditional blockchains cannot provide:


_Progressive Authorization_ : New agents must start with minimal permissions, perhaps $10 daily limits
and restricted service access. Each successful operation contributes to reputation scores,
automatically expanding capabilities.
_Behavioral Adjustment_ : Successful operations should increase authorization over time. A reliable
agent might see limits increase from $10 to $100 to $1,000 as trust accumulates. Conversely,
violations should trigger automatic constraint tightening, reducing limits or requiring additional
verification.
_Trust Portability_ : Trust must transfer across services. An agent with established reputation on one
platform should bootstrap trust on new platforms without starting from zero.
_Verification Economics_ : Without native reputation, every agent interaction starts from zero trust,
forcing expensive verification for routine operations. This overhead makes micropayments
economically impossible.
Proof Chain Architecture
KITE AI provides a complete proof chain from session to agent to user to reputation, all verified by
credited authorities. This chain enables instant trust verification without repeated authentication:
Service providers and users leverage this proof chain to make authorization decisions based on
verifiable history rather than blind trust. For example, a user might grant:
▪ Read access to agents with reputation > 100;
▪ Write access to agents with reputation > 500;
▪ Payment authority to agents with reputation > 750;
▪ Unlimited access to agents with reputation > 900.
This graduated trust model enables safe progressive autonomy while maintaining security.
**Agent Communication Flow**
Human transactions occur in isolation. Agent operations require continuous communication and
coordination. This fundamental difference demands native support for persistent connections,
multi-party coordination, and verifiable message exchange.
Agent to Agent Messaging (A2A)
Encrypted channels enable negotiation, discovery, and coordination without exposing strategies or
private information. The A2A protocol provides structured communication through Agent Cards that
serve as the source of truth for capabilities and endpoints.
_Agent Card Structure:_
Peers fetch Agent Cards to learn capabilities and supported security schemes. The card declares
endpoint URLs, authentication methods, and method availability. Most critically, it includes the Agent
DID and session security scheme so any A2A compatible peer understands how to validate session
scoped credentials.
Service Level Agreements
Programmable contracts enforce response times, availability guarantees, and performance metrics
with automatic penalties. Unlike traditional SLAs based on legal enforcement, these execute
automatically through smart contracts:
▪ Response Time: Service must respond within 100ms or face automatic penalties;
▪ Availability: 99.9% uptime with pro rata refunds for downtime;
▪ Accuracy: Error rates below 0.1% or reputation slashing;
▪ Throughput: Guaranteed 1,000 requests per second minimum.
These programmable SLAs transform vague promises into cryptographically enforced guarantees.
Reputation Networks


Persistent identity and performance tracking enables trust building across multiple interactions and
services. Every interaction contributes to global reputation:
▪ Successful payments increase scores;
▪ Fast responses boost reputation;
▪ Failed deliveries decrease trust;
▪ SLA violations trigger penalties.
Reputation becomes portable across the entire network, solving the cold start problem where new
relationships begin from zero trust.
**Agent Payment Flow**
Traditional payment rails built for large, infrequent charges with human approval loops fail
catastrophically for agent micropayments. Monthly subscriptions and one-time checkouts assume high
fixed fees, settlement delays, chargeback windows, and per transaction minimums that make per
message pricing impossible.
KITE AI inverts this model. Agents open state channels to services, every interaction carries a signed
micro voucher, and a single close nets all balances on chain. Fees amortize across millions of calls.
This enables true micropayments at approximately $0.000001 per message, streaming payments at
rates per second or token, automatic quotas, and instant revocation, all enforced by smart accounts
and session keys. The result: usage-based pricing that feels real time like network packets, not billing
periods.
Channel Opening
The smart account deposits a limit (e.g., $50) into the channel contract. This deposit acts as a bond for
honest behavior. Both parties collectively sign a state update to initialize the channel's state. After
initialization, they can transact quickly and freely off chain without blockchain overhead.
Pay Per Interaction (Off Chain)
Each message or API call carries a voucher signed by the session key.
The channel tracks old state and new state, requiring all participants to agree on state changes. The
merchant accepts work if the voucher validates and falls within quota and TTL. Streaming uses many
small increments, potentially $0.000001 per chunk. Policies including spend caps, allowlists, and
rolling windows are enforced locally by the KITE AI sidecar before voucher production.
Channel Settlement
Channels close through either cooperative or disputed paths:
_Cooperative Close (Happy Path):_
Parties co-sign the final state and submit once. Unused funds immediately return to the user. Gas
costs are minimal. Settlement is instant.
_Disputed Close:_
Either party posts their latest signed state to the blockchain. The counterparty can challenge within the
window by presenting a newer state, ensuring only the most recent update settles. If consensus
breaking situations occur, either party can trigger the on-chain contract to close the channel and
distribute funds.
Common dispute scenarios include:
▪ Participants going offline and failing to propose state transitions;
▪ Participants refusing to co-sign valid state updates;
▪ Participants attempting finalization with outdated states;
▪ Participants proposing invalid state transitions.


```
This dispute mechanism provides trustlessness, ensuring honest parties can exit deposits at any point
regardless of counterparty behavior. The blockchain serves as the ultimate arbiter, guaranteeing that
honest behavior is always rewarded and malicious behavior always punished.
Economic Transformation
This payment architecture enables an economic model impossible with traditional infrastructure:
Granular Pricing : Services price at the level of individual API calls, inference tokens, or compute
milliseconds. A conversation might cost $0.02 in language model inference, $0.001 in embedding
generation, and $0.0001 in storage.
Real Time Economics : Prices adjust dynamically based on load, priority, and resource availability.
Peak hours might cost more. Premium models command higher rates. Urgent requests pay priority
fees.
Automatic Budgets : Agents operate within cryptographically enforced spending limits. When budgets
approach limits, agents automatically throttle or halt operations.
Instant Settlement : No waiting for monthly bills or reconciliation. Every interaction settles immediately.
Services receive payment instantly. Users see real time spending.
The transformation from billing periods to packet economics enables business models that are
impossible with traditional payments. Every message becomes a payment. Every payment becomes
programmable. Every program becomes verifiable. This is the economic foundation for truly
autonomous agents.

### PART I – INFORMATION ON RISKS

## I.1 Offer-Related Risks

```
The admission to trading of KITE entails risks related to market volatility, liquidity availability and
operational execution. Price fluctuations may occur due to secondary market dynamics, and liquidity
may be limited in early trading phases.
```
## I.2 Issuer-Related Risks

```
Not applicable.
```
## I.3 Crypto-Assets-Related Risks

**Market Risk** : Crypto-assets are notoriously volatile, with prices subject to significant fluctuations due
to market sentiment, regulatory news, technological advancements, and macroeconomic factors.
**Liquidity Risk** : Crypto-assets may suffer from low liquidity, making it difficult to buy or sell large
amounts without affecting the market price, which could lead to significant losses, especially in
fast-moving market conditions.
**Custodial Risk** : Risks associated with the theft of crypto-assets from exchanges or wallets, loss of
private keys, or failure of custodial services, which can result in the irreversible loss of crypto-assets.
**Smart Contract Risk:** Smart contracts are code running on a blockchain, executing the programmed
functions automatically if the defined conditions are fulfilled. Bugs or vulnerabilities in smart contract
code can expose blockchain users to potential hacks and exploits. Any flaw in the code can lead to
unintended consequences, such as the loss of crypto-assets or unauthorized access to sensitive data.
**Regulatory and Tax Risk** : Changes in the regulatory environment for crypto-assets (such as
consumer protection, taxation, and anti-money laundering requirements) could affect the use, value, or
legality of crypto-assets in a given jurisdiction.
**Counterparty Risk** : In cases where crypto-assets are used in contractual agreements or held on
exchanges, there is a risk that the counterparty may fail to fulfill their obligations due to insolvency,
compliance issues, or fraud, resulting in loss of crypto-assets.
**Reputational Risk** : Association with illicit activities, high-profile thefts, or technological failures can
damage the reputation of certain crypto-assets, impacting user trust and market value.]

## I.4 Project Implementation-Related Risks

```
As the network relies on validator and module participation, there is an operational risk of
underperformance or service disruption. To mitigate malicious use or misaligned incentives, the
protocol applies a staking-and-slashing mechanism that economically penalises misconduct.
```
## I.5 Technology-Related Risks

```
Private Key Management Risk and Loss of Access to Crypto-Assets : The security of
crypto-assets heavily relies on the management of private keys, which are used to access and control
the crypto-assets (e.g. initiate transactions). Poor management practices, loss, or theft of private keys,
or respective credentials, can lead to irreversible loss of access to crypto-assets.
Settlement and Transaction Finality : By design, a blockchain’s settlement is probabilistic, meaning
there is no absolute guaranteed finality for a transaction. There remains a theoretical risk that a
transaction could be reversed or concurring versions of the ledger could persist due to exceptional
circumstances such as forks or consensus errors. The risk diminishes as more blocks are added,
making it increasingly secure over time. Under normal circumstance, however, once a transaction is
confirmed, it cannot be reversed or cancelled. Crypto-assets sent to a wrong address cannot be
retrieved, resulting in the loss of the sent crypto assets.
```

**Scaling Limitations and Transaction Fees** : As the number of users and transactions grows, a
blockchain network may face scaling challenges. This could lead to increased transaction fees and
slower transaction processing times, affecting usability and costs.
**Economic Self-sufficiency and Operational Parameters** : A blockchain network might not reach the
critical mass in transaction volume necessary to sustain self-sufficiency and remain economically
viable to incentivize block production. In failing to achieve such inflection point, a network might lose
its relevance, become insecure, or result in changes to the protocol’s operational parameters, such as
the monetary policy, fee structure and consensus rewards, governance model, or technical
specifications such as block size or intervals.
**Network Attacks and Cyber Security Risks** : Blockchain networks can be vulnerable to a variety of
cyber-attacks, including 51% attacks, where an attacker gains control of the majority of the network's
consensus, Sybil attacks, or DDoS attacks. These can disrupt the network’s operations and
compromise data integrity, affecting its security and reliability.
**Consensus Failures or Forks** : Faults in the consensus mechanism can lead to forks, where multiple
versions of the ledger coexist, or network halts, potentially destabilizing the network and reducing trust
among participants.
**Bugs in the Blockchain’s Core Code** : Even with thorough testing, there is always a risk that
unknown bugs may exist in a blockchain protocol, which could be exploited to disrupt network
operations or manipulate account balances. Continuous code review, audit trails, and having a bug
bounty program are essential to identify and rectify such vulnerabilities promptly.
**Smart Contract Security Risk** : Smart contracts are code running on a blockchain, executing the
programmed functions automatically if the defined conditions are fulfilled. Bugs or vulnerabilities in
smart contract code can expose blockchain networks to potential hacks and exploits. Any flaw in the
code can lead to unintended consequences, such as the loss of crypto-assets or unauthorized access
to sensitive data.
**Dependency on Underlying Technology** : Blockchain technology relies on underlying infrastructures,
such as specific hardware or network connectivity, which may themselves be vulnerable to attacks,
outages, or other interferences.
**Risk of Technological Disruption** : Technological advancements or the emergence of new
technology could impact blockchain systems, or components used in it, by making them insecure or
obsolete (e.g. quantum computing breaking encryption paradigms). This could lead to theft or loss of
crypto-assets or compromise data integrity on the network.
**Governance Risk** : Governance in blockchain technology encompasses the mechanisms for making
decisions about network changes and protocol upgrades. Faulty governance models can lead to
ineffective decision-making, slow responses to issues, and potential network forks, undermining
stability and integrity. Moreover, there is a risk of disproportionate influence by a group of
stakeholders, leading to centralized power and decisions that may not align with the broader public’s
interests.
**Anonymity and Privacy Risk** : The inherent transparency and immutability of blockchain technology
can pose risks to user anonymity and privacy. Since all transactions are recorded on a public ledger,
there is potential for sensitive data to be exposed. The possibility for the public to link certain
transactions to a specific address might expose it to phishing attacks, fraud, or other malicious
activities.
**Data Corruption** : Corruption of blockchain data, whether through software bugs, human error, or
malicious tampering, can undermine the reliability and accuracy of the system.
**Third-Party Risks** : Crypto-assets rely on third-party services such as exchanges and wallet providers
for trading and storage. These platforms can be susceptible to security breaches, operational failures,
and regulatory non-compliance, which can lead to the loss or theft of crypto-assets.
